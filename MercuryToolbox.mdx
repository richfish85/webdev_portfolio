### **Mercury Toolbox** – Marketing QA Automation Suite

**GitHub:** 
**Tech Stack:** Python, Selenium, Pandas, Regex

Built during my internship at Schneider Electric, *Mercury Toolbox* is a Python-based automation suite designed to assist APAC marketing teams in validating large-scale email campaigns. It includes modular scripts for:

* **Link Verification** – Automatically detects broken or redirected links across HTML email content
* **UTM Parameter QA** – Confirms presence and correctness of tracking parameters in all outbound URLs
* **Content Audit** – Identifies unlocalized text, metadata mismatches, and templating errors
* **Report Generation** – Compiles link health and content issues into shareable CSV reports

The toolkit improved campaign QA efficiency and reduced human error by automating what had been a manual, time-intensive process.
